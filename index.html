  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    A Salesforce Solution Architect and Technical Lead with over a decade of experience in software development and on the Salesforce platform, owning the full delivery lifecycle—from requirements and solution design through configuration, custom development, testing, deployment, and long-term support. I work across multiple Salesforce clouds (Sales, Service, Experience, Marketing, CPQ, and analytics), combining low-code automation with Apex, Lightning, integrations, and Agentforce AI to build scalable, secure, and human-centered solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a strong focus on Agentforce AI–driven experiences—using predictive insights, recommendations, and intelligent automation to simplify work for users and improve decision-making. I’m comfortable leading cross-functional teams, partnering with business stakeholders, BAs, and engineers to turn complex requirements into clear architectures, reliable implementations, and well-documented platforms that continue to evolve with the organization.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over time, I am building a track record of community contribution and real-world impact toward my long-term goal of becoming a <strong>Salesforce MVP</strong>.

  <h2>What I Bring as a Salesforce Solution Architect</h2>

  <h3>End-to-End Architecture</h3>
  <p>
    Design of multi-cloud solutions across Sales, Service, Experience, Marketing, and CPQ, with clear data models, integration patterns, and reference architectures.
  </p>

  <h3>Low-Code First, Code When Needed</h3>
  <p>
    Flow-led automation with guardrails for when Apex and LWC are appropriate, and a focus on reducing technical debt through reusable components and patterns.
  </p>

  <h3>AI, Analytics &amp; Intelligence</h3>
  <p>
    Use of Einstein and Agentforce to surface insights, drive smarter actions, and build dashboards and analytics that track readiness, performance, and adoption.
  </p>

  <h3>Integrations &amp; AppExchange</h3>
  <p>
    Connecting Salesforce with enterprise systems and external apps, and selecting/managing AppExchange solutions with governance and support in mind.
  </p>

  <h3>Security, Org Strategy &amp; Governance</h3>
  <p>
    Role and permission designs that align with real-world access needs, plus standards for environments, branching, releases, and change control.
  </p>

  <h3>Adoption &amp; Enablement</h3>
  <p>
    Clear diagrams, documentation, and training that help teams understand, trust, and use the platform—backed by feedback loops that refine features based on real usage.

  <h2>UC Ready, Business Continuity &amp; ITDR</h2>
  <p>
    A major part of my work is at the intersection of <strong>Business Continuity, IT Disaster Recovery, and Emergency Management</strong> for large public institutions. I help design and evolve the <strong>UC Ready</strong> platform and related processes so universities can understand their critical services, dependencies, and recovery strategies.
  </p>
  <p>
    This includes translating continuity and ITDR requirements into practical Salesforce-based workflows and data models, bringing together business, IT, and emergency management teams on a shared platform, and creating readiness metrics and dashboards that support decision-making before, during, and after disruptive events.
  </p>

    <li>Guides on low-code vs. code, Agentforce/AI usage, and governance</li>
