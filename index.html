    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Salesforce Solution Architect and Senior Developer with 14 years in software development and over 11 years working deeply on the Salesforce platform. My work spans Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Experience Cloud, Marketing Cloud, CPQ, and Einstein Analytics—designing systems that are technically strong, scalable, and easy for teams to adopt.
      </p>
      <p>
        I sit at the intersection of architecture, hands-on configuration, and delivery. I use low-code patterns first, introducing Apex, LWC, and integrations where they create real value. I am also deeply interested in Agentforce and AI-driven intelligence—building smarter automations and decision-making experiences for users.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve led projects unifying sales, service, operations, continuity, and marketing teams onto cohesive Salesforce ecosystems. I focus heavily on data modeling, performance, security, and long-term maintainability, ensuring the platform evolves with the organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work best in collaborative environments—partnering with stakeholders, BAs, product owners, and technical teams to translate ideas into architectures, working solutions, and well-governed platforms.
