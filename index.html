    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        A Salesforce Solution Architect and Technical Lead with over a decade of experience in software development and on the Salesforce platform, owning the full delivery lifecycle—from requirements and solution design through configuration, custom development, testing, deployment, and long-term support. I work across multiple Salesforce clouds (Sales, Service, Experience, Marketing, CPQ, and analytics), combining low-code automation with Apex, Lightning, integrations, and Agentforce AI to build scalable, secure, and human-centered solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a strong focus on Agentforce AI–driven experiences—using predictive insights, recommendations, and intelligent automation to simplify work for users and improve decision-making. I’m comfortable leading cross-functional teams, partnering with business stakeholders, BAs, and engineers to turn complex requirements into clear architectures, reliable implementations, and well-documented platforms that continue to evolve with the organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long term, I’m building toward becoming a <strong>Salesforce MVP</strong> by contributing back to the ecosystem through learning resources, knowledge sharing, and real-world patterns from complex, mission-critical implementations.

        A core part of my work is at the intersection of <strong>Business Continuity, IT Disaster Recovery, and Emergency Management</strong> for large public institutions.

      <h2>Salesforce Community & MVP Journey</h2>
